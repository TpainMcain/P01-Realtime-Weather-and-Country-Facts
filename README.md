# Project 01: Real-Time Country Info & Weather App

## Description:
This application, built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, is designed to retrieve and display a wide array of information about countries around the world, including current weather conditions. The data is dynamically fetched from two primary sources: the Restcountries.com API and the Weatherapi.com API.

## Features
### Restcountries.com API integration
This feature-rich API provides detailed information about various countries. It offers an extensive list of data including a hyperlink to Wikipedia for comprehensive country facts, a flag image file (available in .svg or .png format), and a Google Maps link to the country.

Our application dynamically displays the country flag as an image for a more engaging user experience. Additionally, the Google Maps link provided by the API is also included within the app to aid users in visually locating the country.

### Weatherapi.com API integration
The Weatherapi.com API allows our application to pull real-time weather information for the capital city of the country specified by the user. This includes current conditions, temperature, humidity, and more. As an added feature, we have included a separate search functionality for users who want to retrieve the weather data for other cities as well.

### Search History
For user convenience, our application offers a search history feature. It allows users to easily revisit their previously searched countries with a single click, utilizing local storage to maintain this data across sessions.
